[Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) is one of the awesome terminal emulators!

If you use [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), probably you have already written Lua language.

As you know Neovim's concept is **anything is configurable**, but wezterm is same!

Because as well as Neovim, wezterm's configuration **can be written with Lua, not text like any other terminal emulator !**

## My Wezterm demo !

My Wezterm's demo is here! What are you waiting for?

All you need is getting started! Let's dive into **Wezterm + Neovim !**

Have a nice hack day!

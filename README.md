# My Wezterm Configuration

Wezterm is one of the awesome terminal emulators!
If you use neovim, probably you have already written Lua language.
As you know neovim's concept is anything is configurable, but wezterm is same!
Because as well as neovim, wezterm's configuration can be written with Lua, not text like any other terminal emulator!
